                <h3>Phishing Scams</h3>
                <p>Phishing is a type of email scam, where the sender pretends to be a trustworthy organisation
                    – like a bank, government agency or shipping company – to try to get you to give them personal information, like the login details for your internet banking.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Generic greetings, poor grammar, and suspicious links.</p>
            </article>

                <h3>Romance Scams</h3>
                <p>In romance scams, scammers will try to take advantage of someone looking for a relationship online. 
                    Scammers will use dating sites and apps or social media to build a relationship with you. 
                    Once they’ve gained your trust, the scammer will start to ask you for money, gifts or personal details that can be used to commit fraud. 
                    They often use fake profiles to make it harder to track them down.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Be cautious if someone asks for money or personal information early in the relationship.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Text message scams</h3>
                <p>Fraudsters also use messaging systems and apps, such as SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype,
                     Google Hangouts, and others, to scam you out of money. Phishing scams carried out via SMS are known as “smishing”.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Money and investment scams</h3>
                <p>An investment scam is where you are offered an opportunity to invest your money in a financial product, but the opportunity is fake and the person who offered it is a criminal. 
                    Investment scams will offer opportunities that often seem too good to be true, with little to low risk involved and abnormally high returns,
                     and high-pressure tactics to convince you to invest a large amount or increase your investment.  
                    There are a few ways they can work but the outcome is usually the same: your money is stolen. </p>

                <h3>Online shopping scams</h3>
                <p>Scammers use the latest technology to set up fake retailer websites that look like genuine online stores, 
                    using stolen logos and copied designs. Many of these websites offer popular brands of clothing or jewelry, 
                    or gadgets at low prices. Sometimes you may receive the item you’ve paid for, but often you don't.
                     A more recent version of the scam involves setting up a social media store, which usually disappears after a while to resurface again in another guise.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Clickbait scams</h3>
                <p>“What a trip! That’s right, you’ve won a trip for you and your family to the Bahamas! Click this link to confirm your prize.” 
                    This kind of clickbait has been around for a long time but it’s still tempting and it’s still effective. 
                    With this hoax, the scammer gains the user’s trust to obtain private information.</p>
